The Liver Cirrhosis Detection project aims to develop a computational model or system to aid in the early detection of liver cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. This project typically involves analyzing medical data such as liver function tests, imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound, MRI), and patient demographics to identify patterns and indicators associated with the presence or progression of cirrhosis. Machine learning algorithms or statistical methods may be employed to train the detection model, which could then be integrated into clinical workflows to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and monitoring liver cirrhosis more effectively. The ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through earlier detection and intervention, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with advanced liver disease.
